# portfolio-website

Here is my portfolio. The project section showcases current as well as older projects.  I wanted a site that can show those who view it my progress as a developer who works daily to improve.  Being a developer, although not easy, has become a passion of mine and I am proud of how far I have come.  I hope to be able to use what I have learned to aquire a career as a Software Developer!
